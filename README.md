# JJVM
A VM interoperating with the JVM running on the JVM

## Why?
To learn. Eventually I would like to use an interoperating VM for virtualizing bytecode.

## ToDo
Functionally finish the vm

Migrate VM to zig with JNI bindings

Encrypt bytecode with checksum as dec key

Have multiple bytes resolve to the same "opcode" to defeat heuristics
